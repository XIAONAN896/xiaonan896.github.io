This study examined the relationship between the frequency of mother–child and father–child literacy teaching activities and the reading skills of Chinese preschool children. A total of 105 Hong Kong Chinese preschoolers and their fathers and mothers were involved. Fathers and mothers independently reported the frequency of their own literacy teaching activities (i.e., reading Chinese characters, recognizing Chinese characters based on their pronunciations and writing Chinese characters). Children were tested individually on their Chinese word reading skills, receptive vocabulary and verbal memory. Structural equation modelling was used to assess the relations between mother–child and father–child literacy teaching activities and children's reading skills. The results showed that, although mothers engaged in home literacy teaching activities more frequently than did fathers, the participation of fathers—and not mothers—in Chinese literacy teaching activities significantly predicted their children's Chinese reading skills after controlling for vocabulary, verbal memory and demographic variables (i.e., parental education, the child's age and gender). The results highlight the importance of paternal involvement in home education for Chinese preschoolers' literacy learning.

**Summary:** Evidence that father–child literacy teaching contributes uniquely to preschool children’s word reading skills.
