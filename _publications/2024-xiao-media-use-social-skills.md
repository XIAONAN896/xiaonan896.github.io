Research Findings: The current study examined (1) whether children’s media use during afterschool or bedtime routines, beyond their total media use, contributes uniquely to their peer social skills, and (2) whether joint media engagement serves as a protective factor for any negative associations between media use in daily routines and peer social skills. The study followed 459 children in a Midwestern U.S. state from kindergarten to Grade 1. Teachers reported on children’s peer social skills at both time points. Parents reported frequency of media use in afterschool and bedtime routines, daily media use duration, and joint media engagement. Hierarchical linear modeling was utilized to account for class-level clustering effects. Frequency of media use in afterschool routines negatively predicted children’s peer social skills in first grade, controlling for total media use, peer social skills in kindergarten, and demographics. However, media use in bedtime routines did not significantly predict social skills. Neither of these associations was significantly moderated by parental joint media engagement. Practice or Policy: The current results call for future research focused on effective means to regulate children’s media use in their daily routines to foster positive social development.

**Summary:** Time-diary data examine whether daily media routines relate to social skill profiles in early childhood.
