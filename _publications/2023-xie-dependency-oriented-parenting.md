Utilizing an actor–partner interdependence model, this study examined whether dependency was transmitted from parents to their preschool-aged offspring and, if so, whether dependency-oriented parenting (DOP) mediated such transmission. The mothers and fathers of 488 preschool-aged Chinese children (Mage = 42.36 months, SD = 3.62 months) participated first at 1 month before entry into preschool (Time 1) and then 4 months later (Time 2). Positive relations were found between one parent’s dependency and the child’s physical dependency on that parent (i.e., actor effect), and one parent’s dependency was negatively associated with the child’s emotional dependency on the other parent (i.e., partner effect). Additionally, one parent’s DOP positively predicted the child’s emotional and physical dependency on that parent (i.e., actor effect). Moreover, one parent’s DOP partially mediated the relation between the parent’s dependency and the child’s physical dependency on the parent (i.e., actor effect). Finally, both actor and partner effects were similar for mothers and fathers and for boys and girls. The findings highlight the importance of including both parents and examining actor and partner effects for a comprehensive understanding of the intergenerational transmission of dependency. 

**Summary:** Actor-partner modeling shows how dependency-oriented parenting relates to intergenerational transmission of dependency.
