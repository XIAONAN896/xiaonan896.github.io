Research Findings: Some rural preschools in southwestern China provide boarding services to children aged 3 to 6 years. It is critical to understand these young boarders’ learning experiences and their associations with children’s developmental outcomes. This study aimed to (1) describe children’s daily learning experiences regarding the structural and the process quality, (2) further understand the relations between classroom interpersonal interactions and other process quality indicators, and (3) examine how children’s classroom interpersonal interactions were associated with their social competence and learning outcomes. The study included 32 children from four rural boarding preschools. Alongside systematic live observations of children’s daily experiences over one week, child assessments and teacher- and caretaker-reported questionnaires were administered. Results showed that children frequently experienced no interaction with others. When interactions were observed, teacher-child interactions tended to be of low quality, and most peer interactions happened in a parallel format. Further, children interacted little with peers when a teacher was present or during whole-class, structured, indoor, or academic activities. Teacher directions to children and peer conversations showed negative associations with children’s social competence. Solitary activities negatively predicted expressive vocabulary. Practice or Policy: Implications for the design and enhancement of rural preschools are discussed.

**Summary:** Describes quality indicators in rural boarding preschools and associations with children’s developmental outcomes.
