Research Findings: This study examined the associations between children’s Approaches to Learning (ATL) and their caregiver-child and teacher-child relationships in rural Chinese preschools, distinguishing between boarding and non-boarding children. Teachers reported on ATL and teacher-child relationships for 233 children from rural boarding preschools in December 2018 (Time 1 [T1]) and December 2019 (Time 2 [T2]), while the primary caregivers reported on caregiver-child relationships. Results showed that T1 caregiver-child conflict was linked to lower T2 competence motivation and attention and persistence in children, while T1 teacher-child closeness correlated with increased T2 attention and persistence. Moreover, boarding status moderated some associations between ATL and adult-child relationships. Specifically, T1 caregiver-child closeness had a negative impact on later learning strategy only for boarding preschoolers, whilst T1 competence motivation was positively associated with later teacher-child closeness among non-boarding preschoolers. Practice or Policy: These findings provide valuable insights for tailoring interventions to enhance the approaches to learning in rural boarding preschoolers. Additionally, practical recommendations are outlined for caregivers and teachers.

**Summary:** Cross-lagged models link caregiver/teacher relationships with approaches to learning; boarding status moderates these associations.
