This study examined Hong Kong parents’ need for, and concerns about, the quality of non-parental childcare programs for infants and toddlers. A total of 266 Hong Kong parents whose children were enrolled in center-based childcare programs for infants and toddlers participated in a quantitative survey, and 22 parents participated in qualitative interviews. The results showed that there was a large demand for childcare programs for infants and toddlers in Hong Kong, due mainly to the number of dual working parents. Parents considered location to be the most important determinant of their program selection and also expected an upward adjustment to the teacher-child ratio in their children’s programs. Finally, parents considered mealtime (e.g., bottle feeding), self-care training (e.g., toileting), and cognitive development activities to be the three most important aspects of their children’s educational and care activities. The findings are discussed in light of the importance of developing non-parental childcare programs for infants and toddlers that address parents’ needs and concerns. This study can inform both research and policy concerning center-based childcare programs in Hong Kong.

**Summary:** Parent interviews/surveys describe needs and concerns about infant/toddler childcare programs in Hong Kong.
